# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for wanting to contribute. This repository exists to provide **shared, neutral assets** that participants can use consistently and freely. Contributions should support clarity, accessibility, and broad adoption.

## What This Project Is (and Is Not)

**This project IS:**
- A repository for shared visual assets (PFPs, banners, variations)
- Focused on unity, recognizability, and simplicity
- Designed for mass, frictionless use

**This project is NOT:**
- A place for political debate or arguments
- A forum for ideology, messaging changes, or demands
- A personal branding or signature showcase

If your contribution changes the *message* instead of the *presentation*, it likely doesn’t belong here.

## What You Can Contribute

You’re welcome to submit:
- Alternative sizes or crops (square, circle-safe, high-res)
- Accessibility improvements (contrast, color-blind safe variants)
- Format conversions (SVG, PNG, WebP, transparent versions)
- Minor stylistic refinements that preserve the original intent
- Documentation improvements (README clarity, usage notes)

---

## What You Should NOT Submit

Please do **not** submit:
- Political slogans, demands, or commentary
- Region-specific or faction-specific symbols
- Watermarks, signatures, or branding
- AI prompts instead of actual assets
- Anything that restricts usage or adds licensing conditions

The goal is **one symbol, many users** — not many messages.

## Licensing Requirements

All contributions **must be compatible with CC0-1.0**.

By submitting a contribution, you agree that:
- Your work will be released into the public domain
- Anyone may use, modify, or redistribute it without attribution
- You are not adding restrictions of any kind

If you are not comfortable with this, please do not submit.

## Review Process

- Maintainers may request changes or clarification
- Not all contributions will be accepted
